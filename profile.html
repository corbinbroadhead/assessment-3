                Hello! My name is Corbin Broadhead and I am living in Utah. I am
            a huge Dallas Cowboys fan, as well as a big fan of several other sports
            teams. I like hopping on some games, going outside, and watching movies.
            I am currently a student at Devmountain and am working part-time at
            Papa Murphy's. My goal is to become an iOS Developer and move to where
            snow is rare.
            </p>

            <div class="box-1">Interests</div>
            <p>
                The more you scroll down the more you will learn that most of my interests
            revolve mostly around sports. I love playing, watching, talking, and doing 
            pretty much anything if it's about sports. I also enjoy playing board games,
            video games, watching movies, TV shows, coding, designing logos and graphics
            on Adobe products, caring for and watching documentaries on animals, hiking, 
            and driving around. Utah has some of the most beautiful places on Earth and 
            they also great greatly valuable memories. I suppose I should mention that I 
            am watching YouTube during most of my free time, whether it is just background
            noise or I am actually paying attention.
            </p>

            <div class="box-1">Career Goals</div>
            <h3>Become an iOS Developer</h3>
            <p>
                I love making games and have a couple of board games in the works or already
            made that I wish to translate into apps. I also have a couple of apps that I 
            am hopeful to turn into well-known tools. I look forward to what the future has
            in store and I hope that being an iOS Developer is in store for me.
            </p>
            <h3>Have a Garage</h3>
            <p>
                This one is kind of a joke but also serious. My wife and I always joke about
            how you know you've made it if you have a garage. Keeping the car(s) safe from 
            the weather and other people is something we both look forward to (considering
            the snow and that we drive a car with precious metals exposed).
            </p>
            <h3>Buy a House</h3>
            <p>
                This is another item that my wife and I are super eager for. Currently we are 
            living in an apartment with one room and one 3/4 bathroom. We are very excited to 
            be able to own our own place with enough space for a family and the freedom to 
            decorate and own pets as we please.
            </p>
            <h3>Become a Dad</h3>
            <p>
                This one is hopefully not for another few years, but I am hopeful and excited
            to have kids one day. Obviously I can't know on this side of it but it seems to 
            be one of the most fulfilling things anybody could do.
            </p>
